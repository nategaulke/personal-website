          Iâ€™ve always been interested in technology, more than anyone else in my
          family. My mom always said I would become an engineer. For a while, I
          thought that meant being a mechanical engineer. But after taking a
          programming class in college, I found my passion in software
          engineering.

          <br />
          The marriage of creative problem solving and technology was amazing to
          me. Today, I continue to explore the field both in and out of my job.
          Outside of software engineering, I am passionate about the outdoors,
          traveling, and animation.
