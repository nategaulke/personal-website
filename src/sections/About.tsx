          Iâ€™ve always been interested in technology, more than anyone else in my
          family. My mom always said I would become an engineer. For a while, I
          thought that meant being a mechanical engineer. But after taking a
          programming class in college, I found my passion in software
          engineering. I graduated with my B.S. degree in Computer Science from
          the University of Central Florida in May 2023.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, I continue to explore the software engineering and technology
          both in and out of my job. Outside of software engineering, I am
          passionate about the outdoors, traveling, and animation.
